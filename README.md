# Design Optimization
## Original Title:
Drive Screw Linear Actuator
## Alternative/Similar title:
Mixed integer programming for design optimization of drive screw linear actuator

## Description:
Cost of drive screw linear actuator is minimized using monotonicity analysis, Genetic Algorithm in MATLAB and SQP in OCTAVE. This is a mixed integer optimization problem, one variable takes only integer values. Problem is subjected to strength, functional, space and manufacturing constraints and design varibles are bounded accordingly.

## Proof:
1. Alternative title can be explained from the problem description mentioned in report abstract.
2. 99% accuracy can be verified from the images of results attached.
Monotonicity: Function value = 0.3487 and GA(MATLAB): Function value = 0.3495
3. Accuracy = 100 - (0.3495 - 0.3487)*100/0.3487 = 99.77%
